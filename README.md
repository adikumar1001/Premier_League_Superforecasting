# ‚öΩ Superforecasting: Will Liverpool Win the Premier League (2024/25)?

> A structured, evidence-based forecast that combines historical performance, current form, tactical transition risk, injury depth, rival response, and transfer-window scenarios‚Äîculminating in a **final probability estimate: ~32%** that Liverpool win the 2024/25 EPL (Sherman Kent scale: ‚Äúprobably not‚Äù).

_This README summarizes the analysis documented in the project report (PDF).

## üéØ Problem Statement
Estimate the probability that **Liverpool FC** win the **2024/25 Premier League** using a transparent, structured ‚Äúsuperforecasting‚Äù approach. The goal is not certainty‚Äîit‚Äôs calibrated probability with explicit assumptions, updates, and caveats.

## üîç Executive Summary
- **Prior (titles in last 15 yrs):** ~6.7%  
- **Update: historical + current form context:** ~14%  
- **Update: adapting to Arne Slot‚Äôs tactics:** ~20%  
- **Update: injuries & squad depth across competitions:** ~23%  
- **Update: rivals‚Äô improvement + counter-tactics:** ~29%  
- **Transfer window (strategic signings) scenario:** up to **~32% final**

> Interpretation: **‚ÄúProbably not‚Äù** (Sherman Kent), but still meaningful odds‚Äîsuccess hinges on smooth tactical adaptation, injury management, and targeted reinforcements.

## üß≠ Method (Framework)
This forecast follows a **stepwise, judgmental-Bayesian** update:
1. **Set a Prior** from long-run base rates (title frequency over last 15 seasons).  
2. **Layer Updates** for:  
   - Historical performance & current form  
   - **Arne Slot** system adaptation risk  
   - Injury return timelines, squad depth, multi-competition congestion  
   - Rival trajectories (City, Arsenal, others) & tactical countering  
   - January transfer-window strategy  
3. **Synthesize** into a final calibrated probability and verbal label.

Each update is documented with rationale and supporting sources in the project PDF.
